* Textures, Colors, & Noise

** Colors

** Simplex noise, Perlin noise

# Tying things together: This is useful in its own right (link to
# Conal's blog and anything else I know of), but also is useful as a
# way to apply textures to objects in conjunction with more
# complicated shading (link to Perlin's paper, An image synthesizer).
# Mention this notion of treating textures like a 3D liquid that the
# object is dipped in, versus something 2D that is mapped to an
# object - though, that is done too (link to UV texturing).

# See "Texturing & Modeling" text perhaps?

** Transformations

# See "Programming in 3 Dimensions"

We've used various kinds of transformation on the image so far, but
they haven't really been explained or made explicit.

*** Scaling

*** Translation

*** Rotation

*** Shearing

*** Vectors & Matrices
# Homogeneous coordinates?
# Composition
# Inverses

# Does it even make sense to explain these here, or wait until 3D?  I
# feel like it's just drudgery to go into too much detail explaining
# them here - but it may also be too much too fast to wait until 3D to
# try to explain them.
#
# However, I have no particular reason to explain them *before* the texturing stuff.

# Part of the point is to show that WebGL has built-in support for
# some of these matters, I suppose.

# Misc:
# WebGL 'mix' function - get softer edges on lines?
