Lean Book Maker
===============

This allows you to make your own Lean tutorial, complete with syntax
highlighting and an interactive editor in the browser!

cd mkleanbook/example
make
```

How to use it in your own tutorial
----------------------------------

Check out the `example` subdirectory for a minimal setup  You only need
to adjust the `MKLEANBOOK_PATH` variable in the Makefile to point to your
checkout of `mkleanbook`.  (We usually keep `mkleanbook` as a git submodule.)
