#+Author: Joe Doe

* Heading

You can put lean code in a =BEGIN_SRC= / =END_SRC= block:

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
check nat.rec
#+END_SRC

** Sub-heading

If you only want to show part of the code in the text, then you can enclose the
part of the code that you want to show with =BEGIN= / =END= comments:

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
namespace hide

-- BEGIN
constant and : Prop -> Prop -> Prop
-- END

end hide
#+END_SRC

** Math test
